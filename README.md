<h3>Why did you choose this subject?<h3>
  <p>I chose Django because I've wanted to work with Python, even though I have no experience with the language.</p>

<h3>How were you first made aware of it?</h3>
  <p>I wasn't aware of Django until I started WDI.  I was only vaguely aware of Python before WDI, in that I knew it seemed to be the next language that people were learning.<p>
  
<h3>What problem does it solve?</h3>
 <p>Django offers a way to quickly build database driven applications.  Basically, Django is a framework for Python that makes it really simple to build something that relies on a complex database.</p>
  
<h3>How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?</h3>
  <p>You get a lot of tools right out of the box.  Django is pre-loaded to take care of the heavy lifting, from tracking how things are related to maintaining security.</p>
  
<h3>Why does one use it?</h3>
    <p>I imagine people use Django exactly for the stated reason - that they have a project that involves mountains of data, subsequently resulting in huge databases that are probably pretty difficult to navigate.  For example, Instagram and NatGeo both use Django, and Pinterest did until recently.  These are all cases of huge databases filled users, photos, comments, projects, members, etc.  Django offers a way to keep these sites lightweight and moving quickly, by streamlining a lot of functionality into just a couple of pages.</p>
  
<h3>What are the alternatives?</h3>
  <p>Alternatives include: Pylons, TurboGears, and Flask (which is the framework that Pinterest switched over to).</p>
  
<h3>What is it similar to, if anything?</h3>
 <p>Django employs the MVC (Model-View-Controller) method, which makes it similar to Rails.  Both frameworks work with relational databases.</p>

<h3>What is the history of this technology?</h3>
 <p>Django was built in 2003, in Lawrence, KS,  by two guys who wanted to use build applications with Python.  It was officially released under license in 2005.  The Django Software Foundation has been maintaing Django since 2008.</p>
  <p>Django was named after a French jazz guitarist named Jean 'Django' Reinhardt, who was regarded by many to be one of the best musicians of the 20th century.</p>

<h3>What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?</h3>
 <p>As of right now, I have not built anything with it.  I made a mistake on my initial install this morning, and I have been hitting roadblock after roadblock as a result.  Which is disappointing, because I can really see a utility for Django, and I'm excited to get to play with it.  I especially like the idea of organizing photos and articles with it...I see a possibilty that I could eventually rebuild and really expand my Project 2, using Django.</p>
  
<h3>What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?</h3>
 <p>Not knowing Python made things difficult, but not impossible.  The concepts are close enough to Rails that I was able to mostly follow along.</p>
  
<h3>What resources do you recommend for interested students?</h3>
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Official Django site</a>

<a href="http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python</a>

<p>and Stack Overflow, as always.  I would strongly advise making sure all your installs are done in the proper directories...maybe read the instructions all the way through before you start to follow along.</p>

<h3>What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?</h3>
<p>The docs at djangoproject.com</p>

<h3>What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?</h3>
<p> - What kind of experience do you have with Django?</p>
<p> - Do you like working with it, and can you briefly explain why?</p>
<p> - Are you able to understand Python outside of Django?</p>
  
Also, please include the instructions necessary to...

N/A (so far).

Run your example.
Do I need to run bower install? Do I need an API key?
Use your subject.
Do I need to include it in my HTML with <script> tags? Do I need to brew install anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?
